# Introduction
We develop a multispectral small ship detection dataset from the Sentinel-2 satellite. The dataset comprises 8 original images with  blue, green, red and near-infrared channels under different conditions, such as inshore, cloud, and muddy background cases. We crop the original images to obtain 2494 image patches with 512×512 pixels. This dataset contains more than 5500 annotated ships.The spatial resolution of images in our dataset is 10m × 10m.

The annotations are in YOLO format, i.e. [class_id, x_center, y_center, width, height].
